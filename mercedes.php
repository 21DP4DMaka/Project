    <h1>Mercedes-Benz History</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p>
        Mercedes-Benz (German pronunciation: [mɛʁˌtseːdəs ˈbɛnts, -dɛs -] ⓘ),[6][7] commonly referred to as Mercedes and sometimes as Benz, is a German luxury and commercial vehicle automotive brand established in 1926. Mercedes-Benz AG (a Mercedes-Benz Group subsidiary established in 2019) is headquartered in Stuttgart, Baden-Württemberg, Germany.[1] Mercedes-Benz AG produces consumer luxury vehicles and light commercial vehicles badged as Mercedes-Benz. From November 2019 onwards, Mercedes-Benz-badged heavy commercial vehicles (trucks and buses) are managed by Daimler Truck, a former part of the Mercedes-Benz Group turned into an independent company in late 2021. In 2018, Mercedes-Benz was the largest brand of premium vehicles in the world, having sold 2.31 million passenger cars.[8]The brand's origins lie in Daimler-Motoren-Gesellschaft's 1901 Mercedes and Carl Benz's 1886 Benz Patent-Motorwagen, which is widely regarded as the first internal combustion engine in a self-propelled automobile. The slogan for the brand is "the Best or Nothing".[9]HistorySee also: List of companies involved in the Holocaust, Diesel emissions scandal, and History of the automobileKarl Benz (1844–1929) made the 1886 Benz Patent Motorwagen, which is widely regarded as the first automobile.Mercedes-Benz traces its origins to Karl Benz's first internal combustion engine in a car, seen in the Benz Patent Motorwagen – financed by Bertha Benz's dowry[10] and patented in January 1886[11] – and Gottlieb Daimler and their engineer Wilhelm Maybach's conversion of a stagecoach, with the addition of a petrol engine, introduced later that year. The Mercedes automobile was first marketed in 1901 by Daimler Motoren Gesellschaft (DMG).Emil Jellinek-Mercedes, an Austrian automobile entrepreneur who worked with DMG, registered the trademark in 1902, naming the 1901 Mercedes 35 hp after his daughter Mercedes Jellinek. Jellinek was a businessman and marketing strategist who promoted "horseless" Daimler automobiles among the highest circles of society. At the time, it was a meeting place for the haute volée of France and Europe, especially in winter. His customers included the Rothschild family and other wealthy clients, but as early as 1901, he was selling Mercedes cars in the "New World" as well, including to billionaires Rockefeller, Astor, Morgan, and Taylor. At the Nice race he attended in 1899, Jellinek drove under the pseudonym "Monsieur Mercédès". Many consider that race the birth of Mercedes-Benz as a brand. In 1901, the name "Mercedes" was re-registered by DMG worldwide as a protected trademark. The first Mercedes-Benz branded vehicles were produced in 1926, following the merger of Karl Benz and Gottlieb Daimler's companies into the Daimler-Benz company on 28 June of the same year.[11][12]Gottlieb Daimler (1834–1900) – founder of Daimler-Motoren-GesellschaftGottlieb Daimler was born on 17 March 1834 in Schorndorf. After training as a gunsmith and working in France, he attended the Polytechnic School in Stuttgart from 1857 to 1859. After completing various technical activities in France and England, he started working as a draftsman in Geislingen in 1862. At the end of 1863, he was appointed workshop inspector at a machine-tool factory in Reutlingen, where he met Wilhelm Maybach in 1865.[13]Throughout the 1930s, Mercedes-Benz produced the 770 model, a car that was notably popular throughout Germany's Nazi period. Adolf Hitler was known to have driven in a model of this car during his time in power, with modified custom bulletproof windshields.[14] Most of the currently surviving 770 models were sold at auctions to private buyers. One of the cars is currently on display at the War Museum in Ottawa, Ontario.[15]From 1937 onward, Daimler Benz focused increasingly on military products such as the LG3000 lorry and the DB600 and the DB601 aero engines. To build the latter, in 1936, it built a factory hidden in the forest at Genshagen around 10 km south of Berlin. By 1942, the company had mostly stopped producing cars, and was now devoted to war production. According to its statement, in 1944, almost half of its 63,610 employees were forced labourers, prisoners of war, or concentration-camp detainees.[16] Another source quotes this figure at 46,000. The company later paid $12 million in reparations to the labourers' families.[17]In 1958, the two companies began a partnership to sell their cars in the United States with Studebaker. A few American-based Daimler Benz dealerships were converted into Mercedes-Benz dealerships when Daimler's non-Mercedes-partnered company closed in 1966.Over the decades, Mercedes-Benz has introduced many electronic and mechanical innovations and safety features that later became common.[18] Currently, Mercedes-Benz is one of the best-known and longest-standing automotive brands in the world. The pontiff's Popemobile has often been sourced from Mercedes-Benz.[15]In November 2019, Daimler AG announced that Mercedes-Benz, until that point a company marque, would be spun off into a separate, wholly owned subsidiary called Mercedes-Benz AG. The new subsidiary would manage the Mercedes-Benz car and van business. Mercedes-Benz-badged trucks and buses would be part of the Daimler Truck AG subsidiary.[1]For information relating to the three-pointed star symbol of the brand, see under the title Daimler-Motoren-Gesellschaft, including the merger into Daimler-Benz.In May 2022, Mercedes-Benz announced that it has recently sold the most expensive car at the price of $142 million (€135 million).[19] The car is a very rare 1955 Mercedes-Benz SLR that has been kept in the German automaker's collection and bought by a private owner. Mercedes in an announcement said that the sale will be used to establish the Mercedes-Benz Fund.[20]In June 2022, Mercedes-Benz recalled almost one million vehicles built between 2004 and 2015, due to potential problems with their braking system, caused by possible "advanced corrosion".[21]Subsidiaries and alliancesAs of the Daimler AG company split, the Mercedes-Benz Cars division now handled the Mercedes-Benz- and the Smart-branded cars' production.[22]Mercedes-AMGMercedes-AMG became a majority-owned division of Mercedes-Benz in 1999.[23] The company was integrated into DaimlerChrysler in 1999,[24] and became Mercedes-Benz AMG on 1 January 1999.[25]Mercedes-MaybachDaimler's ultraluxury Maybach brand was under the Mercedes-Benz Cars division until December 2012, when production was stopped due to decreased sales.[26] It now exists under the Mercedes-Maybach name, with the models being luxury-focused, enhanced models of Mercedes-Benz cars, such as the 2016 Mercedes-Maybach S600.[27] The Mercedes-Maybach GLS 600 SUV debuted in November 2019.[28]ChinaDaimler partnered with BYD Auto to make and sell a battery-electric car called Denza in China.[29] In 2016, Daimler announced plans to sell Mercedes-Benz-badged fully electric battery cars in China.[30] Beijing Benz is a joint venture with the BAIC Group to produce the Mercedes-Benz branded cars in China.[31]VietnamEstablished in 1995, Mercedes-Benz Vietnam is a joint venture between Saigon Mechanical Engineering Corporation (SAMCO) and Daimler AG.[32][33] Daimler AG assembles various Mercedes-Benz models from CKD kits at its factory in Ho Chi Minh City.[34][35][36] Before announcing the assembly of AMG models, Mercedes-Benz Vietnam invested approximately 33 million USD in 2021-2022 to upgrade 6 technologies at its factory.[37][38] Chiếc Mercedes E230 đời 1996 thuộc lô xe đầu tiên được xuất xưởng từ nhà máy lắp ráp của Mercedes-Benz Việt Nam.[39][40][41][42] The factory is a joint venture with Sai Gon Mechanical Engineering Corporation.[43][44][45] The 1996 Mercedes E230 was the first car to be produced from the Mercedes-Benz Vietnam assembly plant.[34]ProductionFactoriesOther than in its native birthplace, Germany, Mercedes-Benz vehicles are or have been partly manufactured or assembled in:Sovereign state 	Continent 	NoteAlgeria 	Africa 	Manufactures buses and trucks in cooperation with SNVI (Actros, Zetros, Unimog, and G-Class, Sprinter).Argentina 	South America 	Manufactures buses, trucks, the Vito and the Sprinter van.
